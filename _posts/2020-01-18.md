#installing cloudwatch logs agent on ec2

installing the aws logs package:

```bash
yum install awslogs
```

cd /etc/awslogs

systemctl start awslogsd
systemsctl enable awslogsd

You can then view the logs files in cloudwatch.

by default /var/log/messages is in the /etc/awslogs/awslogs.conf file.

you can then create metric filter on the log and have it send a message to SNS topic when in alarm state.
