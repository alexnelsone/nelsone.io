some queries that help with redshift.


See what users are in a group:
```sql
select usename from pg_user, pg_group where pg_user.usesysid = ANY(pg_group.grolist) 
and pg_group.groname = 'GROUP_NAME';
```


View recently run queries:
```sql
select query, pid, elapsed, substring from svl_qlog
where userid = 100
order by starttime desc
limit 5;
```
