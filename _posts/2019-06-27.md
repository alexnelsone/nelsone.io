some queries that help with redshift.


See what users are in a group:
```sql
select usename from pg_user, pg_group where pg_user.usesysid = ANY(pg_group.grolist) 
and pg_group.groname = 'GROUP_NAME';
```


View recently run queries:
```sql
select query, pid, elapsed, substring from svl_qlog
where userid = 100
order by starttime desc
limit 5;
```

view when table was last scanned.  Could help to see when the table was last accessed since when a select query runs, there is a scan:

```sql
SELECT sti.schema, sti.table, sq.endtime, sq.querytxt
FROM
    (SELECT MAX(query) as query, tbl, MAX(i.endtime) as last_insert
    FROM stl_insert i
    GROUP BY tbl
    ORDER BY tbl) inserts
JOIN stl_query sq ON sq.query = inserts.query
JOIN svv_table_info sti ON sti.table_id = inserts.tbl
ORDER BY inserts.last_insert DESC;
```

Get a list of all the tables in a schema:
```sql
set search_path to 'SCHEMA_NAME';
select distinct(tablename) from pg_table_def where schemaname = 'SCHEMA_NAME';
```

Get a list of all views in a schema and their DDL:

```sql
select table_schema as schema_name,
       table_name as view_name,
       view_definition
from information_schema.views
where table_schema not in ('information_schema', 'pg_catalog') and schema_name = 'SCHEMA_NAME'
order by schema_name,
         view_name;
```
    
    
    
Check for running queries:
```sql
select pid, trim(starttime) as start,
duration, trim(user_name) as user,
substring (query,1,40) as querytxt
from stv_recents
where status = 'Running';
```

delete a running query:
```sql
select pg_terminate_backend(1377);
```
