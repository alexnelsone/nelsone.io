it just seems like everytime i get to working on AWS Lambda, i get some good momentum going and then I'm asked to stop.
then, when i need to get back to it, it always seems like I'm starting from scratch.

this is an attempt to document, at least, the base setup i need to work on lambda.

1. I use IntelliJ as my IDE
2. I do development work on a ChromeBook.

1. need to install pip.
2. need to invite the app to the channel.  otherwise the slack api returns a not_in_channel error.
